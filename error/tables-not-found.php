        <h2>Database Error</h2><br>
        <div class="text-warning">
            The web interface has connected to the database, but could not find any tables generated by LiteBans.
            <br>
            This means that the plugin has not successfully connected to this database before with the same configuration.
            <br>
            LiteBans needs to be connected to this database before the web interface can display anything!
            <br><br>
            Solutions:
            <br>
            - Check the startup logs to see if there are any errors.
            <br>
            - Ensure that the plugin is using the MySQL driver (not SQLite) to connect to the database.
            <br>
            - Ensure that the table prefix is the same in config.yml and settings.php.
